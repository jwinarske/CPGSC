Since I have chosen to keep the initialization for each COM port in
a separate file, modifications to the SIO definition require
modifying four files: COM1SIO.C, COM2SIO.C, COM1SIO.C, and COM3SIO.C.
I automated this time-consuming and error-prone process:

1. Perform all your modifications to COM3SIO.C until you get IBMPC.C (which
   includes it) to compile.

2. Run the MAKESIO batch file.  This makes three copies of COM3SIO, one 
   for each SIO, then replaces the variable names with those appropriate
   for that SIO.  For example, the baudC becomes baudA, baudB, etc.

3. After running the batch file, all SIOs are functionally identical. This
   is obviously not desirable if you wish to initialize them differently.
